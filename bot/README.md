# Building Your Own Zoom Appliance (aka, the Zoom-bot!)

<img align="right" width="400" src="img/zoom-bot-1.jpg">
These instructions will help you build your own Zoom-bot. The goal is to turn a Windows 10 computer into an appliance with one purpose: joining Zoom meetings. The script is written to keep the end product as straightforward as possible, with the goal of non-technical users being able to use the device.

## Materials Required

* A Windows 10 compatible computer (preferable, an All-In-One)
    * Dell Inspiron One computers work wonderfully for this, as they have high quality JBL speakers, a touch screen, and a decent web camera.

    * Other All-In-One machines will work as well, but many are not touch screen, which will also require a mouse.
