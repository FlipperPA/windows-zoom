# Building Your Own Zoom Appliance (aka, the Zoom-bot!)

<img align="right" width="400" src="img/zoom-bot-1.jpg">
These instructions will help you build your own Zoom-bot. The goal is to turn a Windows 10 computer into an appliance with one purpose: joining Zoom meetings. The script is written to keep the end product as straightforward as possible, with the goal of non-technical users being able to use the device.

I will try to keep these instructions as clear as possible, but you're going to need intermediate technical know-how of Windows to make this happen. If you've installed Windows on your own, and know what a command prompt is, you're probably advanced enough to build your own Zoom-bot. If you haven't, there are many YouTube videos and tutorials online which might help, but I'm afraid I don't have time to answer every inquiry I get, as I'm already swamped building these out for recovery meetings in the Philadelphia area.

## Materials Required

* A Windows 10 compatible computer (preferably an All-In-One)
    * Dell Inspiron One computers work wonderfully for this, as they have high quality JBL speakers, a touch screen, and a decent web camera. [You can find these on eBay](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_trksid=p2334524.m570.l1313&_nkw=dell+inspiron+one+%282305%2C2310%2C2320%2C2330%29&_sacat=171957), but *BE CAREFUL*; many are being sold for parts, so read the description *IN FULL*.
    * Other All-In-One machines will work as well, but many are not touch screen, which will also require a mouse.
* An omnidirectional microphone, to pick up speech in the room, [such as this one](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B076ZVZWC4/).
    * You may also want a longer USB cable to be able to extend it to the center of the room, [such as this one](https://smile.amazon.com/Extension-AINOPE-Material-Transfer-Compatible/dp/B07ZV6FHWF/).
* A mount with wheels and VESA mounting interface, [such as this one](https://smile.amazon.com/Rfiver-Rolling-Universal-Display-Trolley/dp/B07JHWCQW5/).
* A power strip with a long lead cable, [such as this one](https://smile.amazon.com/Kensington-Guardian-15-Foot-Protector-K38215NA/dp/B00PBWV6SW/).
* Zip ties to keep cabling contained, [such as these](https://smile.amazon.com/Pounds-Tensile-Strength-Pieces-Karoka/dp/B08K4PTCW1/).
* A USB flash drive to install Windows 10. [You can create Windows 10 installation media with this tool](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209).
